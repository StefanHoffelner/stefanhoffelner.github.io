title: A $\Sigma^1_4$ wellorder of the reals with $\text{NS}_{\omega_1}$ saturated.
authors: Sy-David Friedman and Stefan Hoffelner
year: 2019
journal: Journal of Symbolic Logic
pdf: "/papers/sample-paper.pdf"
abstract: >
 We show that, assuming the existence of the canonical inner model with one Woodin cardinal $M_1$, there is a model of $\mathsf{ZFC}$ in which the nonstationary ideal on $\omega_1$ is 
 $\aleph_2$-saturated and whose reals admit a $\Sigma^1_4$-wellorder.
